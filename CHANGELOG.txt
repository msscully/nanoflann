nanoflann 1.1.0: (In svn/trunk)
  * Fixed warnings for MSVC and for GCC with "-Wall -pedantic"
  * Updated performance tests to work with the final nanoflann code (they were 
     written for a very early version).
  * All main classes now have new template arguments for the type of indice, 
     which now defaults to "size_t" instead of "int". In case this breaks 
     backward compatibility in user code, especify "int" to override the default 
     template arguments, although "size_t" it's recommended.

nanoflann 1.0.0: Released Aug 30, 2011
  * Initial version
