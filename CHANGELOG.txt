nanoflann 1.1.1: (In svn/trunk)
  * Some fixes to kd_tree index and L1/L2 metrics to allow distinct types 
     in data elements and in the distances. This is mainly to permit elements 
	 being vectors of integers (e.g. uint8_t) but distances being real numbers.
  * Examples and unit tests have been corrected to use template arguments 
     instead of being hard-wired to "float" data types (Thanks Thomas Vincent 
	 for noticing!).

nanoflann 1.1.0: Released Dec 15, 2011
  * Fixed warnings for MSVC and for GCC with "-Wall -pedantic"
  * Updated performance tests to work with the final nanoflann code (they were 
     written for a very early version).
  * All main classes now have new template arguments for the type of indice, 
     which now defaults to "size_t" instead of "int". In case this breaks 
     backward compatibility in user code, especify "int" to override the default 
     template arguments, although "size_t" it's recommended.
